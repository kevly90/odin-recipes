    <em>While many of us may have been introduced to treacle tarts thanks to Harry Potter, it's actually a traditional British dessert. This recipe is from <a href="https://www.daringgourmet.com/treacle-tart/">Daring Gourmet</a></em>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <em>Serves 1</em>

    <h3>Shortcrust Pastry</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter , chilled</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons lard , chilled</li>
        <li>1/3 cup ice cold water
    </ul>

    <h3>Treacle Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (450 g) golden syrup</li>
        <li>grated zest and juice of one lemon</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (100 g) fresh white breadcrumbs (do not use store-bought. Use fresh bread and either let it sit out for one day or toast the slices and then pulse them in a food processor)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>For the Shortcrust Pastry:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the flour and salt in a food processor and pulse to blend. &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Next add the cold butter and lard.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Pulse a few more times until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Add the water a little at a time, pulsing between additions, until the mixture begins to come together. DO NOT over-mix the dough or the pastry crust will be tough and won&apos;t be flaky.</li>
        <li>The mixture is done when it resembles large streusel-like crumbs and when you take some and press it between your fingers it will hold together.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a ball, flatten into a 1-inch thick disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using. (The shortcrust pastry can be refrigerated for a few days or frozen for up to 3 months.)</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pastry dough. &nbsp;I find it easiest to roll it out on to plastic wrap, it makes transferring it to the tart pan easy. Roll the pastry dough out so that there&apos;s a little excess around all sides of the tart pan (it will shrink when baked). You will need a <strong>9-inch fluted&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QIZ1I2?ie=UTF8&tag=thedargou09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B000QIZ1I2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>tart pan with a removable bottom</strong></a> (also commonly called quiche pans).</li>
        <li>Carefully place the pastry crust into the tart pan and pierce it multiple times with a fork.</li>
        <li>Line the pastry crust with parchment paper and fill it with dried beans or similar.</li>
        <li>Place the tart on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the beans and parchment paper and continue to bake for another 5-10 minutes or until the crust is a very pale golden.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For the treacle filling: While the shortcrust is baking prepare the filling.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the golden syrup, lemon zest and lemon juice in a medium saucepan.</li>
        <li>Heat the syrup until hot and runny and then stir in the breadcrumbs. &nbsp;Turn off the heat and let the mixture sit for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly beat the egg and cream together with a fork.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg/cream mixture into the saucepan with the treacle mixture and stir quickly to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot mixture into the tart crust.</li>
        <li>Place the tart on the middle shelf of the oven (still heated at 375 degrees F) and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the pastry is golden and the filling is nicely browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool.</li>
        <li>Treacle tart is traditionally served warm with clotted cream, whipped cream, or custard. You can also serve it with ice cream.</li>
    </ol>
